# The Prime Factors Kata

Here is a kata for the Prime Factors problem.

This is a very short Kata. The final algorithm is three lines of code. Interestingly enough there are 40 lines of test code.

Although quite short, this kata is fascinating in the way it shows how ‘if’ statements become ‘while’ statements as the number of test cases increase. It’s also a wonderful example of how algorithms sometimes become simpler as they become more general.

I stumbled upon this little kata one evening when my son was in 7th grade. He had just discovered that all numbers can be broken down into a product of primes and was interested in exploring this further. So I wrote a little ruby program, test-first, and was stunned by how the algorithm evolved.
